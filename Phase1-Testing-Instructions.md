# Phase 1 DPI Testing Instructions

## What Was Changed in Phase 1

âœ… **Completed**: Modern DPI configuration using .NET 8's built-in DPI handling
- Removed conflicting DPI declarations from app.manifest
- Leveraging `ApplicationHighDpiMode.PerMonitorV2` from project configuration
- Build now succeeds without DPI warnings

## Testing Phase 1 Changes

### Current State
- The application still uses the custom `DpiScalingService` (will be removed in Phase 2)
- However, the foundation for modern DPI handling is now properly configured
- Windows will now handle DPI scaling more effectively

### Test Instructions

1. **Test at 100% Windows Scaling (Baseline)**:
   - Right-click desktop â†’ Display settings
   - Set "Scale and layout" to 100%
   - Run `HWIDChecker.exe`
   - Verify: Application should look normal (current working state)

2. **Test at 125% Windows Scaling**:
   - Change Windows scaling to 125%
   - Run `HWIDChecker.exe`
   - Verify: Application may still have scaling issues (expected, since custom DPI service is still active)
   - Note: Interface should be slightly clearer than before Phase 1

3. **Test at 150% Windows Scaling**:
   - Change Windows scaling to 150%
   - Run `HWIDChecker.exe`
   - Verify: Application may still be unusable (expected)
   - Note: This will be fixed in Phase 2 when we remove the custom DPI service

### What to Look For

#### âœ… Expected Improvements (Phase 1):
- **Cleaner build**: No more DPI-related build warnings
- **Slightly better text rendering**: Text may appear slightly sharper at high DPI
- **Foundation ready**: App is now properly configured for modern DPI handling

#### ðŸ”„ Still Expected Issues (Fixed in Phase 2):
- **Oversized windows**: Still happening due to custom DPI service
- **Invisible buttons**: Still occurring due to scaling conflicts
- **Unusable at 150%+**: Will be resolved when custom scaling is removed

## Next Steps

If Phase 1 testing shows improvement (even small), we can proceed to **Phase 2**:
- Remove the custom `DpiScalingService`
- Update `MainFormLayout` to use Windows Forms automatic scaling
- Replace manual scaling with layout containers

This will resolve the core scaling conflicts and make the application usable at all DPI settings.

## Test Results Template

Please test and report:

```
Phase 1 Test Results:
- 100% scaling: [Working/Issues]
- 125% scaling: [Better/Same/Worse than before]
- 150% scaling: [Better/Same/Worse than before]
- Overall impression: [Improvement noticed/No change/Worse]
```

Ready to proceed to Phase 2? The real improvements will come when we remove the conflicting custom DPI system.
