# Project Refactoring Plan

## Current Issues
- Some namespaces and folder structures could be better organized
- UI-related components are spread across multiple locations
- Service interfaces and implementations are mixed in the same directory
- Hardware-related components could be better structured

## Proposed Directory Structure Changes

```
HWID-Checkers/Software-Project/
├── src/                                 # Source code (renamed from 'source')
│   ├── HWIDChecker.Core/               # Core functionality
│   │   ├── Hardware/                    # Hardware-related implementations
│   │   │   ├── Components/             # Individual hardware component classes
│   │   │   ├── Interfaces/            
│   │   │   └── Manager/               
│   │   └── Services/                   # Core services
│   │       ├── Comparison/             # Comparison-related services
│   │       ├── Export/                 # Export-related services
│   │       ├── Cleaning/               # System cleaning services
│   │       └── Interfaces/             # All service interfaces
│   ├── HWIDChecker.UI/                 # UI-specific code
│   │   ├── Components/                 # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── Forms/                      # Windows Forms
│   │   ├── Handlers/                   # UI event handlers
│   │   └── Themes/                     # UI theming and styling
│   └── HWIDChecker.Win32/              # Win32 API interactions
│       └── SetupApi/                   # Setup API specific code
└── build/                              # Build outputs (bin, obj)
```

## Specific Changes

1. **Directory Reorganization**
   - Separate core functionality into HWIDChecker.Core folder
   - Create dedicated UI folder (HWIDChecker.UI)
   - Create Win32 interop folder (HWIDChecker.Win32)

2. **Hardware Module Restructuring**
   - Move all hardware-related classes to Components subfolder
   - Create proper interfaces folder for hardware abstractions
   - Centralize hardware management in Manager folder

3. **Services Reorganization**
   - Group related services into subdirectories (Comparison, Export, Cleaning)
   - Move all interfaces to dedicated Interfaces folder
   - Better separation of service implementations

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Consolidate all UI-related code in HWIDChecker.UI folder
   - Group forms logically
   - Separate themes and styling
   - Better organization of event handlers

5. **Build Output Organization**
   - Create dedicated build directory
   - Move all build artifacts out of src directory
   - Improve build script organization

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Better module boundaries
   - Easier to find and maintain code

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Logical grouping of related functionality
   - Reduced coupling between components
   - Clearer dependency structure

3. **Enhanced Scalability**
   - Easier to add new features
   - Better support for future testing
   - Clearer extension points

4. **Documentation**
   - Better organized documentation
   - Clear separation of code and docs
   - Improved project navigation

## Implementation Notes

- All changes are structural only - no logic modifications
- Ensure all namespace declarations are updated
- Update project references as needed
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Update build scripts and configurations

## Migration Strategy

1. Create new directory structure
2. Move files to new locations
3. Update namespace declarations
4. Update project references
5. Verify build and functionality
6. Remove old directories
